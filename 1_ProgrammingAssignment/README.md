# Compilation and running the program 

To make and run the program:

1. Head to the *build-ProgrammingAssignment1-Desktop_Qt_6_1_0_GCC_64bit-Debug* folder in a terminal
1. Run *make all*
1. One the make file finishes, run *./ProgrammingAssignment1*

There are 2 ways to see the lifting and multiplication functions in action:

* _To run a specific set of RGB values and see the corresponding YCoCg values in both functions_:
	* Enter a specific Red, Green, and Blue value, and press the _pushButton_ to see the YCoCg results of those input
	
* _To observe the running times per lifting and multiplication functions_:
	* Enter a min and max rgb value in the _Min RGB Values(O min)_ and _Max RGB Values(255 max)_ to run a series of operations of every rgb combination in that range possible. 
	* __Running the program with a min of 0 and a max of 255 may result in crashes__
