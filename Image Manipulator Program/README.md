# Image Transformer Program

The program here takes a bmp image, and produces a grayscale, grayscale dither, and autoleveled versions of it. It is used to demonstrate the algorithms behind dithering, grayscaling rgbs, and histogram equalization.

## How to run

Double click the `Image Manipulator` file to run. It's a shortcut to an executable in the `build` folder named `Project_1`. Selecting an image
via `New Image` will begin processing the versions of the image. Hitting `Next` will go through these images and choosing `Get Histogram` will
display a rgb histogram of the images in the current window.

**Note** The program takes longer with larger bmp files.
