# Image Transformer Program

The program here transforms a given bmp image and then reverses the transform. This is supposed to demonstrate quality loss when applying 
RGB->YCoCg colour space, Discrete-Cosine Transformation, and Quantization.

## How to run

Double click the `Image Transformer` file to run. It's a shortcut to an executable in the `build` folder named `Project_1_Video`. When selecting 
an image and running the program, it will produce a modified image bmp, along with the results of Co, Cg, and Y values. 

**Note** The program takes significantly longer with larger bmp files. The given sample is provided in a 640 x 426 resolution
